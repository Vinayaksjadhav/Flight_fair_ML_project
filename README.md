# Flight_fair_ML_project

This machine learning project aims to predict the prices of flight tickets based on various features such as airline, source, destination, departure and arrival times, and 
the number of stops. The goal is to assist travelers and airlines in estimating ticket prices more accurately, ultimately helping travelers plan their trips more efficiently.
we use Random Forest Regressor Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique used for both regression and classification tasks. In this project, we used it as a regression model to predict flight ticket prices, which is a numerical prediction task.
